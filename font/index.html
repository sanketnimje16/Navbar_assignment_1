        <h1 style="color:red; font-weight: bold;font-size: 26px;">Rohit Sharma restrains himself from praising Yashasvi Jaiswal despite match-winning double-century</h1>
        <!-- the word wrapping short key which is "alt + z" --> 
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">With players injured or unavailable for selection, Rohit Sharma led India to a famous win over England in Rajkot, one that could well be the most cherished. <br> Rohit Sharma and adversity are hardly strangers; if anything, adversity has shadowed the Indian captain like an obsessed stalker. Yet, Rohit has found a way around it, time after time.Earmarked for his debut against South Africa in Nagpur in February 2010, Rohit suffered a freak ankle injury playing football minutes before the toss. That set his maiden Test appearance back by three and a half years, until November 2013.Discover the thrill of cricket like never before, exclusively on HT. Explore now! <br>
            When the all-format captaincy came calling in early 2022, it was no surprise. Rohit had already stamped his leadership credentials in both the IPL and international cricket on a stand-in basis, and he extended that to Test cricket with subliminal ease.
            Rohit went to South Africa last December aspiring to become the first Indian captain to win a Test series there. Within three days, those dreams lay in tatters as the Proteas breezed to victory in the first game in Centurion. Just as India were floundering, Mohammed Siraj provided the inspiration with a searing burst on the opening morning of the Cape Town Test, orchestrating a two-day win that gave the visitors a share of the spoils.
            This series against Ben Stokes’ Bazballing England, however, would be Rohit’s biggest challenge as Test captain. With their attacking mindset and unfettered approach, England would present the kind of examination India had seldom encountered in their backyard. How would they respond? Would India’s traditional methodology work, or would it buckle under the intensity of Bazball?

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), the security wing of the Civil Aviation Ministry, has asked the airlines to ensure that the passengers’ checked-in luggage reach them within 30 minutes after their arrival. It has asked the airlines to implement measures to ensure timely baggage delivery by February 26. This, ministry officials said, was done as part of the efforts taken to avoid congestion at airports and to have better security.“Airlines need to ensure that delivery of last baggage is made within 30 minutes as per the Service Quality Requirements of Operation, Management and Delivery Agreement (OMDA). BCAS has directed the airlines to implement the required measures within 10 days by 26th February 2024,” a statement issued by the civil aviation ministry said. <br>
        An official close to the development said that BCAS has been studying the time taken by airlines to clear the passengers from the arrival halls of six majorairports since January this year. These airports include Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chennai.</p>

        According to the notification, CBSE wants to streamline the process of schools sending the observations and requested that observations be uploaded on OECMS on the same day the examination is conducted.
        CBSE has also informed that in case the observations received are not clear or not received on time, no action will be taken by the board.
        Kerala Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) Model Exam will be commencing from tomorrow with students appearing for language papers on day one.
